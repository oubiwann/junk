To get started with these scripts, you will need to download the latest code
and then bootstrap some basic configuration:
    $ bzr branch lp:~oubiwann/+junk/pm-scripts
    $ cd pm-scripts/wiki
    $ ./bin/<script-name> --bootstrap

When running any of the scripts with the --bootstrap (or -b) option, a new
config file will be generated for you (old ones are backed up) and saved to
your ~/.oempmwiki directory. You will be queried to input Google and wiki
sign-in information.  All of this will be written to the [DEFAULT] section of
your config INI file.

You can execute scripts against different wiki and Google data by adding new
sections in your INI file.

Once you are set up with a config INI file, you can execute your script with
the following:
    $ ./bin/<script name> -c <section name>
For instance:
    $ ./bin/update_project_states -c DEFAULT
or
    $ ./bin/update_project_states -c Testing
